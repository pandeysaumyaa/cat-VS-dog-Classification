 Cat vs. Dog Image Classification
This project involves the classification of images into two categories: cats and dogs. The task is accomplished using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a deep learning model particularly effective in image recognition tasks.

Project Overview

 1. Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust image classification model that can accurately distinguish between images of cats and dogs.

 2. Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of thousands of labeled images of cats and dogs. It is sourced from the [Kaggle Cats vs. Dogs dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/d4rklucif3r/cat-and-dogs). The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure the model's generalization.

### 3. Model Architecture
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was employed to perform the classification. The architecture includes:
- Convolutional Layers: These layers apply filters to the input images to capture spatial hierarchies.
- Pooling Layers: Used for down-sampling the feature maps, reducing the dimensionality while retaining important features.
- Fully Connected Layers: These layers interpret the features extracted by the convolutional layers and make the final classification.

### 4. Model Training
- Optimizer: Adam optimizer was used for training, providing efficient gradient descent.
- Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy loss was used due to the binary nature of the classification task.
- Data Augmentation: Techniques such as rotation, flipping, and zooming were applied to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's robustness.
- Epochs and Batch Size: The model was trained over several epochs with a specific batch size to optimize learning.

 5. Evaluation
The performance of the model was evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics on the validation and test datasets. The model achieved high accuracy, demonstrating its ability to correctly classify images of cats and dogs.
